# Register a headless, self-hosted VS Online environment

You can host a VS Online environment on your own hardware using the headless CLI. This article describes how to register and connect to a headless VS Online server.

> [!NOTE]
> A Microsoft Account and Azure Subscription are required to use Visual Studio Online. Sign up for a Microsoft Account and Azure Subscription at [https://azure.microsoft.com/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Install VS Online for self-hosting

VS Online CLI tools can be used on [Windows](~/reference/vsonline-cli.md#windows), [macOS](~/reference/vsonline-cli.md#macos), and [Linux](~/reference/vsonline-cli.md#linux) environments. For installation instructions, see [VS Online CLI Reference](~/reference/vsonline-cli.md#installation).

## Register your machine

You must create a VS Online plan before starting the registration process. For more information on creating a plan, see [create a plan](browser.md#create-a-plan) in our browser how-to guide.

Once you've successfully installed the CLI, start the interactive registration process by running the [`vso start`](~/reference/vsonline-cli.md#start-vs-online) command.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure you're running the process as the user you'd like to use when accessing the environment from other machines after registration.

### Register as a service

> [!NOTE]
> You must have administrator permissions to be able to select this option. For macOS and Linux, we do not recommend running with sudo.

As part of registration, you will be asked to sign-in with your VS Online account and provide the existing plan this environment should be registered to.

#### Windows

Register the self-hosted agent as a service by running the following command from a terminal/command line that is running as an admin user.

```bash
vso start --service
```

You will be prompted for your Windows login password.

#### macOS

Register the self-hosted agent as a service by running:

```bash
vso start --service
```

You may be prompted for a sudoers password (unless another sudo command has recently been successfully authenticated/authorized).

#### Linux

>[!NOTE]
> `systemd` must be installed to run as a service for Linux.

Register the self-hosted agent as a service by running:

```bash
vso start --service
```

You will be prompted to confirm if you want to run `loginctl enable-linger` to keep the agent running even when logged off.

### Run as a process

> [!NOTE]
> When running as a temporary process, the agent will stop as soon as the process exits. This will make the environment switch to an Unavailable stat,  and you will not be able to connect to the environment until the agent process is restarted. If you'd like the agent to be installed long-term, consider running as a service instead.

Once you've successfully installed the CLI, run the self-hosted agent as a temporary process by running:

```bash
vso start
```

As part of registration, you will be asked to sign-in with your VS Online account and provide the existing plan this environment should be registered to.

## Access your environment

You can now connect to your self-hosted VS Online environment from any machine with the VS Online extension installed, or from the [VS Online portal](https://online.visualstudio.com/environments) in the browser. The first time you connect may take longer than usual.

If your self-hosted environment becomes unavailable for any reason, see our [troubleshooting](~/resources/troubleshooting.md#self-hosted-environments) reference documentation.

## Known Issues

### Unauthorized error when attempting to register environment - Reported April 9, 2020
When attempting to register an environment through the CLI, process returns an "Unauthorized" error.

#### Workaround
Currently, we can only register an environment to a plan that matches the region you are currently in. 
Please select a plan in your region to complete registration.
