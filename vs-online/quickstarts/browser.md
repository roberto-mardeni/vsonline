# Visual Studio Online Quickstart

Welcome to Visual Studio Online! We're glad you're here.

Visual Studio Online provides cloud-powered development environments for any activity - whether it's a long-term project, or a short-term task like reviewing a pull request. You can work with these environments from Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio ([sign up for the Private Preview](https://aka.ms/vsfutures-signup)), or a browser-based editor that's accessible anywhere! You can even connect your own self-hosted environments to Visual Studio Online at no cost.

Additionally, Visual Studio Online brings many of the benefits of DevOps, like repeatability and reliability, which have typically been reserved for production workloads, to development environments. However, Visual Studio Online is also personaliazable to allow developers to leverage the tools, processes and configurations that they have come to love and rely on - truly the best of both worlds!

Ready to get going? This document will walk you through how to install VS Online, create a cloud-hosted environment, connect to it, run and debug the environment's application, disconnect and delete the environment.
